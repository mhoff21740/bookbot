# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

Book Bot is a beginner-friendly Python project that analyzes the text of novels and generates a statistical report of word and character usage. This project served as my introduction to Python development and marked my first end-to-end coding experience using professional tools and practices.

Key Features:

* Parses plain-text novels to compute word frequencies and character distribution.

* Outputs a clean, structured report summarizing key text statistics.

* Designed to handle varying input lengths and character sets.

* Technologies & Tools:

* Python for scripting and analysis

* Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the development environment

* Git & GitHub for version control and project deployment

* Learning Highlights:

* Configured a full Python development environment locally

* Gained hands-on experience using VS Code and GitHub

* Practiced writing clean, modular Python code from scratch

* Understood how to break down a project into functional components
